Polyglot Jupyter notenook Boilerplate code


[Polyglot Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_(computing)) refers to the ability  to use multiple programming languages in one domain app  . 
this would allow great interopability between services , libraries ,SDK and frameworks and allow you to use your own  favourite  techstack  in  unified runtimebackendplatform

dotnet core is a great modren framework and backend runtime that have great flexibility to extend,
there's often muliple ways to do this , either by  exposing low level code  throught [FFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface)which call external basecodelibrary in callstack  then [abstract the API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapper_function)   callbacks using [P/invoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_Invocation_Services) or by using  [reflection and marshling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_binding) by using [DLR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/reflection-and-codedom/dynamic-language-runtime-overview)


Google colab is a great platform to build and run Jupyter Notebooks .
